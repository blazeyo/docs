# Prerequisites

In order to Dockerize your environment you must install:
* Docker Engine
* (optional) [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## OS

We recommend using Docker on [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/) host. Docker for [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/) and [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/windows/) is still in experimental phase and some of the instructions you can find on documentation pages may give different results.
