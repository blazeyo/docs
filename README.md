Drupal Docker Initiative
==================

Drupal Docker Initiative (DDI) was created to help understand and adapt Docker to projects based on Drupal.

We are here to bring Docker awesomeness to your life. Use one of our Drupal-tailored images to build lightweight, shippable environment for your app. Use it on all stages of project life cycle - your local machine, test, staging or production environment.
