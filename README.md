Drupal Docker Initiative
==================

Drupal Docker Initiative (DDI) was created to help understand and adapt Docker to projects based on Drupal.

Use one of our Drupal-tailored images to build lightweight, shippable environment for your app. Use it on all stages of project life cycle - your local machine, test, staging or production environment.
